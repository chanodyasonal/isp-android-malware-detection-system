Project Title
Android Malware Detection Web Application
Project Summary
The Android Malware Detection Web Application project aims to develop a web-based platform 
for scanning Android application (.apk) files and providing real-time predictions on whether 
they are malicious or safe. Leveraging machine learning models, this tool will enhance 
cybersecurity for Android users by identifying potential threats.
Project Objectives
 Create a user-friendly web application for .apk file scanning.
 Develop and integrate machine learning models for malware detection.
 Ensure efficient and accurate predictions.
 Enhance Android app security awareness among users.
Target Audience
 Android users seeking to verify the safety of .apk files.
 App developers and security professionals.
 Researchers and analysts focused on Android app security.
Project Scope
The project encompasses:
 Web application development for .apk file scanning.
 Integration of machine learning models for malware detection.
 User authentication and account management.
 Real-time prediction and reporting.
 Documentation and user guides.
Project Deliverables
 A fully functional web application for .apk file scanning.
 Machine learning models for malware detection.
 User authentication and data management systems.
 Comprehensive documentation and user guides.
